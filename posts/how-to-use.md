There's not much to it.

* First copy this site's theme to your ruhoh (~2.0) site source
* edit your config.yml, make sure you use this theme
* edit your index.html, it should be empty
* it's layout should be: 'angular'
* create a _root/home.html, fill it with whatever you like
* next, uhm wait! there's no next ;-)
