<p>This example post content is dynamically loaded using angularJS.</p>

<p>Have a look at <strong>_root/index.html</strong>. It&#39;s layout is defined as &#39;angular&#39; and thus
the theme&#39;s <strong>layouts/angular.html</strong> file is used as layout.</p>

<p>This loads some javascript (some provided by angular, an app.js and a controller/main.js)</p>

<p>Now, when clicking on any resource, we navigate to: <pre><code>#/&lt;resource&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>instead of <pre><code>/&lt;resource&gt;</code></pre>
 This is picked-up by the angularJS router
which loads the ruhoh-pre-generated static content. Of course in a single page setup. </p>
