**This version is for [ruhohSpec v2.1](http://ruhoh.com/docs/2) and is only compatible with ruhoh 2.1.x**


This is an example project that contains a special theme. This theme contains all there is
to it to convert a 'standard' static ruhoh site to a angularJS enabled static ruhoh site.

Cool, eh ?
